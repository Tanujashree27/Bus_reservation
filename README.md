The Bus Booking System is a C program designed to manage seat reservations for a bus with up to 30 seats. Users can book seats by providing their name, seat number, source, and destination; view all current reservations; edit existing reservations; and print tickets for specific seats. The system saves all booking data to a binary file (`bookings.dat`) to ensure data persistence between program runs. The program features a user-friendly menu interface and handles input validation, such as checking for duplicate seat bookings and invalid seat numbers. It is a simple yet effective tool for managing bus reservations, with all data automatically saved and loaded upon program startup and exit.
